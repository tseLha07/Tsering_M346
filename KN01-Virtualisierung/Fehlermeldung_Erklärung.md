## Erkl√§rung warum eine Fehlermeldung

The total memory of the running virtual machines cannot be greater than the amount of physical memory on the host excluding additional memory reserved for the host to operate properly while virtual machines are running but we can have a host with 2GB memory and create four virtual machines with 1GB memory each. In that case, the memory is overcommitted.
